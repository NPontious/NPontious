### Hi, I'm Nick.

I'm a developer and engineering student with a passion for the intersection of hardware and software. I love building interesting things, from AI that can play card games to custom-designed circuit boards.

Right now I'm studying Computer Engineering, learning the low-level details that make all this high-level fun possible. When I'm not coding, you can probably find me tinkering with my NixOS config or planning my next project.

### Some Things I've Built

Here are a few projects that I've had a lot of fun working on:

*   **Euchre Projects:** I've spent a good amount of time exploring the game of Euchre. I started by building a simple version in Java Swing (`SwingEuchre`), and  I've been working on an AI bot (`PyTrick`) to play the game.
*   **Game & Level Generation:** Procedural generation is fascinating to me. I've created projects in Godot (`MapGen`) and Java (`Level-Generation`) to generate game levels and maps.
*   **Hardware Design:** Bridging the gap between digital and physical, I'm working on designing a fully-functional chessboard PCB from scratch in KiCad (`ChessPCB`).
*   **Mobile Development:** I've explored cross-platform mobile development with Flutter in my `PowerTrip` app to learn how RESTFUL APIs work.
